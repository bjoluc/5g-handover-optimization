= Power Modeling <chapterPowerModeling>

Based on the power models presented in Section~@secRelWorkPower, this chapter covers the design and evaluation of a 5G @nr @ue power model to predict @ue power consumption in the context of handover optimization.
Section~@secPowerModelRequirements analyzes the requirements for such a model.
Subsequently, the model is developed in Section~@secPowerModelDesign and evaluated in Section~@secPowerModelValidation.
