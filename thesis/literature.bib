  abstract  = {5G and future 6G networks support diverse combinations of access technologies, architectures, and radio frequencies, with each combination termed as a "band" henceforth. Through comprehensive measurements in 12 cities across 5 countries, we experimentally show that operator-configured default bands are often highly sub-optimal, particularly under mobility. We then propose smart band switching, where a UE's band can be dynamically changed to improve the network performance and boost the application QoE. We discuss challenges, opportunities, and design choices for building a practical smart band switching system. We further develop preliminary UE-side band-switching logic on commodity smartphones, and evaluate it on commercial 5G networks.},

  abstract   = {O-RAN is currently emerging as the way to build a virtualized 5G and beyond Radio Access Network (RAN) that is based on open interfaces and off-the-shelf hardware. O-RAN consolidates the intelligence of several gNodeBs at the Near-realtime RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) making it more programmable and aware of the mobile users’ surroundings. In this paper we present Roadrunner, an O-RAN-based solution designed to improve cell selection in 5G and beyond networks. Our work has been motivated by the fact that the legacy cell selection procedure in both 4G and 5G networks tends to prefer radio quality and seamless connectivity to high data rates. The reason for this can be traced back to the older releases of the mobile network architecture that were optimized for the circuit-switched communication paradigm and for sparse network deployments. However, with an O-RAN-based approach we can leverage the global network view built and maintained by the Near-realtime RIC to jointly optimize mobility management for channel quality and bitrate. We have designed Roadrunner following the O-RAN Alliance design principles and without requiring any change to the existing 3GPP signaling. No changes to the mobile devices are required either. Performance measurements carried out on a small scale testbed show how Roadrunner can almost double the median throughput in some specific traffic scenarios while also achieving better network fairness.},

  abstract   = {In this paper, we propose iCellSpeed, an on-device solution to increase data access speed by substantiating unrealized performance potentials. We find that performance potentials are missed in today's mobile networks, as the data speed a user device gets is much lower than what the device could get. The issue is rooted in the current cell selection practice, which misses good candidate cells that offer faster access speed, thus under-utilizing the available capabilities in mobile networks. We design iCellSpeed to facilitate network-controlled cell selection with proactive device-side assistance towards more desirable cells. Our evaluation over AT\&T and Verizon confirms its effectiveness. iCellSpeed increases data access speed by more than 10 Mbps at 79\% of test locations ({\textgreater} 25Mbps at 29\% of locations, up to 80.6 Mbps). It doubles access speed at 62.5\% of locations with the gain up to 28.4x. Datasets are available at [9].},

While mobile-env provides sensible default values and can be used out of the box, it also has many configuration options and is easy to extend. We therefore believe mobile-env to be a valuable platform for driving meaningful progress in autonomous coordination of wireless mobile networks.},

	abstract = {Reinforcement Learning ({RL}) is a continuously growing field that has the potential to revolutionize many areas of artificial intelligence. However, despite its promise, {RL} research is often hindered by the lack of standardization in environment and algorithm implementations. This makes it difficult for researchers to compare and build upon each other's work, slowing down progress in the field. Gymnasium is an open-source library that provides a standard {API} for {RL} environments, aiming to tackle this issue. Gymnasium's main feature is a set of abstractions that allow for wide interoperability between environments and training algorithms, making it easier for researchers to develop and test {RL} algorithms. In addition, Gymnasium provides a collection of easy-to-use environments, tools for easily customizing environments, and tools to ensure the reproducibility and robustness of {RL} research. Through this unified framework, Gymnasium significantly streamlines the process of developing and testing {RL} algorithms, enabling researchers to focus more on innovation and less on implementation details. By providing a standardized platform for {RL} research, Gymnasium helps to drive forward the field of reinforcement learning and unlock its full potential.

	doi = {10.14569/IJACSA.2021.0120298},
	abstract = {The Millimeter Wave (mm-wave) band has a broad-spectrum capable of transmitting multi-gigabit per-second date-rate. However, the band suffers seriously from obstruction and high path loss, resulting in line-of-sight ({LOS}) and non-line-of-sight ({NLOS}) transmissions. All these lead to significant fluctu-ation in the signal received at the user end. Signal fluctuations present an unprecedented challenge in implementing the fifth gen-eration (5G) use-cases of the mm-wave spectrum. It also increases the user’s chances of changing the serving Base Station ({BS}) in the process, commonly known as Handover ({HO}). {HO} events become frequent for an ultra-dense dense network scenario, and {HO} management becomes increasingly challenging as the number of {BS} increases. {HOs} reduce network throughput, and hence the significance of mm-wave to 5G wireless system is diminished without adequate {HO} control. In this study, we propose a model for {HO} control based on the offline reinforcement learning ({RL}) algorithm that autonomously and smartly optimizes {HO} decisions taking into account prolonged user connectivity and throughput. We conclude by presenting the proposed model’s performance and comparing it with the state-of-art model, rate based {HO} scheme. The results reveal that the proposed model decreases excess {HO} by 70\%, thus achieving a higher throughput relative to the rates based {HO} scheme.},

  abstract   = {Handover (HO) management is essential in mobile cellular networks. It ensures seamless connectivity to the User Equipment (UE) while moving from one Base Station (BS) to another within the coverage area. HO optimization refers to the adoption of intelligent and automatic HO techniques in mobile networks. HO optimization is gaining more importance in Fifth-Generation (5G) and Beyond (B5G) systems because of the requirements and specifications that B5G targets. The requirements of B5G include global connectivity, ultra-low latency, big data analytics, extreme data rate transmissions, a massive number of devices in a small area, and new technologies that will support the B5G network, such as Millimeter Wave (mmWave), Terahertz (THz) communication, and Ultra-Dense Networks (UDNs). All these factors cause new HO optimization challenges and require new solutions for HO optimization techniques. This study comprehensively provides HO optimization challenges and solutions in B5G. First, it provides a research background and explanation of HO in legacy. It then investigates the HO optimization challenges in B5G, including future research directions. The paper then discusses the most prominent and recent techniques and technological solutions for HO optimization management in B5G. Finally, we highlight potential techniques for HO optimization in B5G.},

To accomplish this objective, a power model has been developed for evaluation of power saving schemes related to Radio Resource Management in Radio Resource Control (RRC) Connected mode among other topics. In this work, we examine the power saving potential in RRC Connected mode using a single-user numerical simulation tool employing the user equipment power model. We demonstrate that the use of short Discontinuous Reception (DRX) can provide 26 \% energy saving and 74 \% latency reduction as compared to the long DRX-only baseline. Furthermore, the simulation results, based on the user equipment power model, show that four Physical Downlink Control Channel (PDCCH) optimization monitoring schemes: cross-slot scheduling, reduced blind PDCCH decoding candidate set, wake-up signaling and go-to-sleep signaling, may further reduce the energy consumption 17-20 \% at the cost of a latency increase and potentially lower overall network performance.},

	abstract = {Smartphone users struggle with short battery life, and this affects their device satisfaction level and usage of the network. To evaluate how chipset  manufacturers and mobile network operators can improve the battery life, we propose a Long Term Evolution ({LTE}) smartphone power model. The idea is to provide a model that makes it possible to evaluate the effect of different terminal and network settings to the overall user equipment energy consumption. It is primarily intended as an instrument for the network engineers in deciding on optimal network settings, but could also be beneficial for chipset manufacturers to identify main power consumers when taking actual operating characteristics into account. The smartphone power consumption model includes the main power consumers in the cellular subsystem as a function of receive and transmit power and data rate, and is fitted to empirical power consumption measurements made on state-of-the-art {LTE} smartphones. Discontinuous Reception ({DRX}) sleep mode is also modeled, because it is one of the most effective methods to improve smartphone battery life.Energy efficiency has generally improved with each Radio Access Technology  ({RAT}) generation, and to see this evolution, we compare the energy efficiency of the latest {LTE} devices with devices based on Enhanced Data rates for {GSM} Evolution ({EDGE}), High Speed Packet Access ({HSPA}), and Wi-Fi*. With further generations of {RAT} systems we expect further improvements. To this end, we discuss the new {LTE} features, Carrier Aggregation ({CA}) and  Enhanced Physical Downlink Control Channel ({EPDCCH}), from an energy  consumption perspective.Not surprisingly, the conclusion is that having the cellular subsystem {ON}, and in addition, transmit powers above 10 {dBm}, have the largest effect on {UE} power consumption, and that the combination of high data rates and long sleep periods is the optimal combination from a user equipment energy-saving perspective.},

However, we have a weak understanding of a mobile user's quality of experience (QoE) and the factors influencing it.

Quantitative relationships between {QoE} and {QoS} are required in order to be able to build effective {QoE} control mechanisms onto measurable {QoS} parameters. Against this background, this article proposes a generic formula in which {QoE} and {QoS} parameters are connected through an exponential relationship, called {IQX} hypothesis. The formula relates changes of {QoE} with respect to {QoS} to the current level of {QoE}, is simple to match, and its limit behaviors are straightforward to interpret. It validates the {IQX} hypothesis for streaming services, where {QoE} in terms of Mean Opinion Scores is expressed as functions of loss and reordering ratio, the latter of which is caused by jitter. For web surfing as the second application area, matchings provided by the {IQX} hypothesis are shown to outperform previously published logarithmic functions. We conclude that the {IQX} hypothesis is a strong candidate to be taken into account when deriving relationships between {QoE} and {QoS} parameters.},

	abstract = {Handover ({HO}) is one of the key aspects of next-generation ({NG}) cellular communication networks that need to be properly managed since it poses multiple threats to quality-of-service ({QoS}) such as the reduction in the average throughput as well as service interruptions. With the introduction of new enablers for fifth-generation (5G) networks, such as millimetre wave (mm-wave) communications, network densification, Internet of things ({IoT}), etc., {HO} management is provisioned to be more challenging as the number of base stations ({BSs}) per unit area, and the number of connections has been dramatically rising. Considering the stringent requirements that have been newly released in the standards of 5G networks, the level of the challenge is multiplied. To this end, intelligent {HO} management schemes have been proposed and tested in the literature, paving the way for tackling these challenges more efficiently and effectively. In this survey, we aim at revealing the current status of cellular networks and discussing mobility and {HO} management in 5G alongside the general characteristics of 5G networks. We provide an extensive tutorial on {HO} management in 5G networks accompanied by a discussion on machine learning ({ML}) applications to {HO} management.

	abstract = {In typical wireless cellular systems, the handover mechanism involves reassigning an ongoing session handled by one cell into another. In order to support increased capacity requirement and to enable newer use cases, the next generation wireless systems will have a very dense deployment with advanced beam-forming capability. In such systems, providing a better mobility along with enhanced throughput performance requires an improved handover strategy. In this paper, we will detail a novel method for handover optimization in a 5G cellular network using reinforcement learning ({RL}). In contrast to the conventional method, we propose to control the handovers between base-stations ({BSs}) using a centralized {RL} agent. This agent handles the radio measurement reports from the {UEs} and choose appropriate handover actions in accordance with the {RL} framework to maximize a long-term utility. We show that the handover mechanism can be posed as a contextual multi-armed bandit problem and solve it using Q-learning method. We analyze the performance of the methods using different propagation and deployment environment and compare the results with the state-of-the-art algorithms. Results indicate a link-beam performance gain of about 0.3 to 0.7 {dB} for practical propagation environments.},

The quantitative measures proposed in the literature are either too specific to a particular application, or suffer from some undesirable characteristics. In this paper, we have introduced a quantitative measure called Indiex of {FRairness}. The index is applicable to any resource sharing or allocation problem. It is independent of the amount of the resource. The fairness index always lies between 0 and 1. This boundedness aids intuitive understanding of the fairness index. For example, a distribution algorithm with a fairness of 0.10 means that it is unfair to 90\% of the users. Also, the discrimination index can be defined as 1 - fairness index.},

We present - to the best of our knowledge - the first comprehensive and comparative cross-country measurement study of commercial mid-band 5G deployments in Europe and the U.S., filling a gap in the existing 5G measurement studies. We unveil the key 5G mid-band channels and configuration parameters used by various operators in these countries, and identify the major factors that impact the observed 5G performance both from the network (physical layer) perspective as well as the application perspective. We characterize and compare 5G mid-band throughput and latency performance by dissecting the 5G configurations, lower-layer parameters as well as deployment settings. By cross-correlating 5G parameters with the application decision process, we demonstrate how 5G parameters affect application {QoE} metrics and suggest a simple approach for {QoE} enhancement. Our study sheds light on how to better configure and optimize 5G mid-band networks, and provides guidance to users and application developers on operator choices and application {QoE} tuning.

The key distinct feature of the dataset is in the nature of the data, which is based on real {LTE} traffic information decoded from control channel information at the millisecond level.

Our analysis shows that mobile data traffic exhibits self-similarity and the number of Radio Resource Control ({RRC}) connected users exhibits a bi-modal distribution.

	abstract = {Statistical depths have been well studied for multivariate and functional data over the past few decades, but remain under-explored for point processes. A first attempt on the notion of point process depth was conducted recently where the depth was defined as a weighted product of two terms: (1) the probability of the number of events in each process and (2) the depth of the event times conditioned on the number of events by using a Mahalanobis depth. We point out that multivariate depths such as the Mahalanobis depth cannot be directly used because they often neglect the important ordering property in the point process events. To deal with this problem, we propose a model-based approach for point process systematically. In particular, we develop a Dirichlet-distribution-based framework on the conditional depth term, where the new methods are referred to as Dirichlet depths. We examine mathematical properties of the new depths and conduct asymptotic analysis. In addition, we illustrate the new methods using various simulated and real experiment data. It is found that the proposed framework provides a reasonable center-outward rank and the new methods have accurate decoding in one neural spike train dataset.},

In this paper, a new multi-step state-action value algorithm is proposed to solve the problem of reward hacking. Unlike traditional algorithms, the proposed method uses a new return function, which alters the discount of future rewards and no longer stresses the immediate reward as the main influence when selecting the current state action. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated on two games, Mappy and Mountain Car. The empirical results demonstrate that the proposed method can alleviate the negative impact of reward hacking and greatly improve the performance of reinforcement learning algorithm. Moreover, the results illustrate that the proposed method could also be applied to the continuous state space problem successfully.},

	abstract = {The reward signal is responsible for determining the agent’s behavior, and therefore is a crucial element within the reinforcement learning paradigm. Nevertheless, the mainstream of {RL} research in recent years has been preoccupied with the development and analysis of learning algorithms, treating the reward signal as given and not subject to change. As the learning algorithms have matured, it is now time to revisit the questions of reward function design. Therefore, this chapter reviews the history of reward function design, highlighting the links to behavioral sciences and evolution, and surveys the most recent developments in {RL}. Reward shaping, sparse and dense rewards, intrinsic motivation, curiosity, and a number of other approaches are analyzed and compared in this chapter.},

	abstract = {We propose a new family of policy gradient methods for reinforcement learning, which alternate between sampling data through interaction with the environment, and optimizing a "surrogate" objective function using stochastic gradient ascent. Whereas standard policy gradient methods perform one gradient update per data sample, we propose a novel objective function that enables multiple epochs of minibatch updates. The new methods, which we call proximal policy optimization ({PPO}), have some of the benefits of trust region policy optimization ({TRPO}), but they are much simpler to implement, more general, and have better sample complexity (empirically). Our experiments test {PPO} on a collection of benchmark tasks, including simulated robotic locomotion and Atari game playing, and we show that {PPO} outperforms other online policy gradient methods, and overall strikes a favorable balance between sample complexity, simplicity, and wall-time.},

	abstract = {The theory of reinforcement learning provides a normative account, deeply rooted in psychological and neuroscientific perspectives on animal behaviour, of how agents may optimize their control of an environment. To use reinforcement learning successfully in situations approaching real-world complexity, however, agents are confronted with a difficult task: they must derive efficient representations of the environment from high-dimensional sensory inputs, and use these to generalize past experience to new situations. Remarkably, humans and other animals seem to solve this problem through a harmonious combination of reinforcement learning and hierarchical sensory processing systems, the former evidenced by a wealth of neural data revealing notable parallels between the phasic signals emitted by dopaminergic neurons and temporal difference reinforcement learning algorithms. While reinforcement learning agents have achieved some successes in a variety of domains, their applicability has previously been limited to domains in which useful features can be handcrafted, or to domains with fully observed, low-dimensional state spaces. Here we use recent advances in training deep neural networks to develop a novel artificial agent, termed a deep Q-network, that can learn successful policies directly from high-dimensional sensory inputs using end-to-end reinforcement learning. We tested this agent on the challenging domain of classic Atari 2600 games. We demonstrate that the deep Q-network agent, receiving only the pixels and the game score as inputs, was able to surpass the performance of all previous algorithms and achieve a level comparable to that of a professional human games tester across a set of 49 games, using the same algorithm, network architecture and hyperparameters. This work bridges the divide between high-dimensional sensory inputs and actions, resulting in the first artificial agent that is capable of learning to excel at a diverse array of challenging tasks.},

	abstract = {The increasing wireless data traffic demands have driven the need to explore suitable spectrum regions for meeting the projected requirements. In the light of this, millimeter wave ({mmWave}) communication has received considerable attention from the research community. Typically, in fifth generation (5G) wireless networks, {mmWave} massive multiple-input multipleoutput ({MIMO}) communications is realized by the hybrid transceivers which combine high dimensional analog phase shifters and power amplifiers with lower-dimensional digital signal processing units. This hybrid beamforming design reduces the cost and power consumption which is aligned with an energy-efficient design vision of 5G. In this paper, we track the progress in hybrid beamforming for massive {MIMO} communications in the context of system models of the hybrid transceivers' structures, the digital and analog beamforming matrices with the possible antenna configuration scenarios and the hybrid beamforming in heterogeneous wireless networks. We extend the scope of the discussion by including resource management issues in hybrid beamforming. We explore the suitability of hybrid beamforming methods, both, existing and proposed till first quarter of 2017, and identify the exciting future challenges in this domain.},
